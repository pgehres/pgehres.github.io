My name is Peter Gehres. Most recently I was a Staff Security Engineer at Lacework with an 
amazing team that was sadly broken up due to the Fortinet acquisition of Lacework. 
(P.S. - If one of them applies to your company, hire them!) Before that I was at AppDynamics 
for seven years, half before and half after the Cisco acquisition, starting in SRE and later
becoming a founding member of the security team. Prior to AppDynamics, I worked at the Wikimedia 
Foundation for two years as a software engineer. You saw my work if you saw a fundraising banner 
in 2011 or 2012!

Since 2017 I have co-led the Black Team for the Southwest Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense 
Competition (SWCCDC) which designs, builds, deploys, and operates a simulated IT environment
designed to give students an opportunity to test their skills against professional red teams 
through scenarios representing real-word experiences of information security professionals. I 
competed for four years during my time as a student and I firmly believe that participating in
CCDC, both the preparation for and the competition itself, was the best educational experience
I received for my career in SRE/DevOps and information security.
